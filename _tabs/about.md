Setting up and configuring monitoring and logging tools to track the performance and activity of cloud environments. Staying up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in cloud infrastructure management. and am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow my skills.

In my free time, you can find me tinkering with new technologies, building my own computers, or attending tech conferences and events. I also enjoy practicing ethical hacking, and implementing the strong understanding of computer networks and systems, including common protocols and technologies such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and SSL. I also have programming skills, as this can be useful for creating custom tools and scripts for testing and debugging systems.
