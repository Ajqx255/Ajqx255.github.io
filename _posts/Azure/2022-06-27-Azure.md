# Setting up and Deploying a Web Page with Azure

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform and infrastructure created by Microsoft for building, deploying, and managing applications and services through a global network of Microsoft-managed data centers. In this article, we will be showing you how to set up and deploy a simple web page on Azure.

**Prerequisites**

Before getting started, you'll need the following:

- A Microsoft Azure account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a free account here.
- A basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Step 1: Creating an Azure Web App**

To deploy a web page on Azure, you'll need to create an Azure Web App. An Azure Web App is a platform for building, deploying, and scaling web applications on Azure.

1. Log in to the Azure portal.
2. Click the "Create a resource" button on the left-hand side of the screen.
3. Search for "Web App" and select it from the results.
4. Click the "Create" button to create a new Web App.
5.  Fill in the necessary information, such as the app name, resource group, and runtime stack. You can also choose a free pricing tier to keep costs low while testing.
6. Click the "Review + create" button to review your settings, and then click the "Create" button to create the Web App.
7.  Wait for the deployment to complete, which should take a few minutes.

# Step 2: Creating Your Web Page

Now that you have an Azure Web App set up, you need to create your web page.

8. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Web App you just created.
9. Click on the "Development Tools" section, and then click on "Visual Studio Code."
10. In Visual Studio Code, create a new file called "index.html."
11. Add the following code to the file:

php

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My First Azure Web Page</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Hello, Azure!</h1>
      </body>
    </html>

# Step 3: Deploying Your Web Page

Now that your web page is created, you need to deploy it to your Azure Web App.

12. In Visual Studio Code, click on the "Explorer" icon on the left-hand side of the screen.
13. Right-click on the "index.html" file and select "Copy Path."
14. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Web App you created.
15. Click on the "Development Tools" section, and then click on "Advanced Tools."
16. Click on the "Go" button to launch the Kudu service.
17. In the Kudu service, click on the "Debug console" drop-down menu and select "CMD."
18. In the CMD console, navigate to the "site" folder.
19. Type the following command and press enter: echo "" > index.html
20. Type the following command and press enter: notepad index.html
21. Paste the path to your "index.html" file into Notepad and save the file.
22. Navigate to your Web App's URL, which should be in the format of https://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net.
23. You should see your web page with the message "Hello, Azure!" displayed.
